# udemy-microfrontends-with-react

Code for Steven Grider's Udemy Course "Microfrontends With React"

## section-01

A very generic microfrontend app with a container, cart, and products. All built in vanilla JS with Webpack in support.

## section-04

The second project in the course. A not so generic microfriend with auth and marketing built in React, a dashboard in Vue, and a container in plain JS. There are also some requirements:
_ No coupling between child projects
_ Near-zero coupling between container and child apps
_ CSS from one project shouldn't affect any of the others
_ Version control (monorepo v. separate) shouldn't have any impact on the overall project \* Container should be able to decide to always use the latest version of a microfrontend **or** specify a specific version
